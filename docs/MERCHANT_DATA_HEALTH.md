# Merchant Data Health

This document explains how data health works in your analytics dashboard
and what each status means for you.

## What is Data Health?

Data health tells you whether the numbers in your dashboards and reports
are current and complete. We continuously monitor your data sources and
let you know if anything needs your attention.

## Health States

Your data health will show one of three states:

### Healthy

**What it means:** Your data is up to date and all features are available.

- Dashboards show current numbers
- AI insights are active
- Data exports are available

**What to do:** Nothing! Everything is working as expected.

### Delayed

**What it means:** Some of your data is being refreshed. This is usually
temporary and resolves on its own.

- Dashboards are available, but some numbers may be slightly behind
- AI insights are paused until the update finishes
- Data exports are paused to avoid incomplete data

**What to do:** You can continue using your dashboards. AI insights and
exports will resume automatically once the update completes.

### Unavailable

**What it means:** Your data is temporarily unavailable while we process
updates.

- Dashboards are not available
- AI insights are paused
- Data exports are paused

**What to do:** Please wait a few minutes and try again. If the issue
persists, contact our support team using the "Contact Support" button
that appears on screen.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Why is my data delayed?

Data updates happen on a regular schedule. Occasionally, an update may
take longer than usual. This is normal and your data will catch up
shortly.

### How long does a delay last?

Most delays resolve within a few hours. If you see a delay lasting
longer than expected, our team is already aware and working on it.

### Should I worry about "Delayed" status?

No. Your dashboards are still usable during a delay. The numbers shown
are from the most recent completed update. AI insights are paused only
as a precaution to ensure recommendations are based on the latest data.

### What does "Unavailable" mean for my business?

It means we are temporarily unable to display your data. This does not
mean your data is lost. Once the update completes, everything will be
restored. If you need immediate assistance, please contact support.

### Will I lose any data?

No. All your data is safely stored. Health states only affect whether
we can display it to you right now.

### How do I contact support?

When data is unavailable, a "Contact Support" button appears on your
dashboard. Clicking it opens an email pre-filled with your account
information so our team can help you quickly.
